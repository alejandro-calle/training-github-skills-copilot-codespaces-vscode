// Create a web server
// 1. Create a new Express application
// 2. Create a new route for GET requests to '/comments'
// 3. When a GET request is made to '/comments', respond with an array of comments (e.g. `[{"username": "Todd", "comment": "lol"}, {"username": "Skyler", "comment": "rofl"}]`)

// 4. Listen for incoming requests on port 4001, and log a message to the console to confirm that the server is running.
